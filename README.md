# **ü§ñ Agentic Sales Co-Pilot**

An autonomous, multi-agent system designed to automate sales email outreach, intelligently process replies, and provide a human-in-the-loop interface for sales representatives via Slack.

## **üöÄ Core Features (Current Version)**

* **Autonomous Email Campaign Creation:** A Sales_Manager agent orchestrates a team of specialized agents to generate multiple email drafts, select the best one, and create a personalized subject line.  
* **Personalized Bulk Emailing:** Sends personalized emails to a list of prospects from a .csv file, using placeholders for both the subject and body.  
* **Intelligent Reply Processing:** Automatically receives email replies via a SendGrid webhook. A dedicated SDR_Agent then analyzes the reply's content to classify its intent and summarize its key points.  
* **Interactive Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interface:** The agent's analysis is sent as an interactive notification to a Slack channel, allowing a human user to take action.  
* **One-Click Actions:** From Slack, a user can:  
  * **Approve & Send:** Immediately send the AI-drafted reply.  
  * **Edit & Send:** Open a pop-up modal to edit the draft before sending.  
  * **Discard:** Mark the reply as handled without taking further action.  
* **Structured Logging:** All application events are logged in a structured JSON format for easy monitoring and debugging.  
* **Secure & Configurable:** Manages all secret keys and configuration safely through environment variables.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation**

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### **1. Clone the Repository**

- `git clone <your-repository-url>`
- `cd <your-repository-name>`

### **2. Install Dependencies**

This project uses Poetry for dependency management. Ensure you have Poetry installed, then run:

`poetry install`

### **3. Configure Environment Variables**

Create a file named .env in the root of the project directory. This file stores all your secret keys and configuration.

# .env

# --- API Keys ---  
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."  
SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG. ..."  
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-..."

# --- Configuration ---  
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID="C0..." # The ID of the Slack channel for notifications

### **4. Set Up External Services**

* **SendGrid:**  
  1. Create an API Key with full access to Mail Send.  
  2. Verify a "Single Sender" email address (e.g., business@yourdomain.com).  
  3. Set up **Inbound Parse** on a subdomain (e.g., replies.yourdomain.com) and point its Destination URL to your ngrok forwarding URL.  
  4. Add the provided MX record (mx.sendgrid.net) to your domain's DNS settings for that subdomain.  
* **Slack:**  
  1. Create a new Slack App named "SDR Agent Notifier".  
  2. Add the chat:write and commands Bot Token Scopes under "OAuth & Permissions".  
  3. Install the app to your workspace and copy the Bot User OAuth Token.  
  4. Enable "Interactivity & Shortcuts" and set the Request URL to your ngrok forwarding URL.  
  5. Invite the bot to your designated channel using /invite @SDR Agent Notifier.

### **5. Create the Prospect List**

Create a file named prospects.csv in the project root. It must contain headers that match the placeholders used in the email templates (e.g., FirstName, Company, Position).

FirstName,LastName,Email,Company,Position  
Jane,Doe,jane.doe@example.com,Example Corp,CTO

## **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application (Updated for Task Queue)**

This application is a distributed system and requires **four long-running services** for full functionality during local development. It's recommended to open four separate terminal windows.

### **Terminal 1: Start Redis**

Redis acts as the message broker for background tasks. The easiest way to run it is with Docker.

`docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine`

### **Terminal 2: Start the Celery Worker**

This process listens for tasks from Redis and executes the long-running agent logic.

`poetry run celery -A app.tasks worker --loglevel=INFO`

### **Terminal 3: Start the Webhook Server**

This server listens for inbound webhooks from SendGrid and Slack on your local machine.

`poetry run python webhook_server.py`

### **Terminal 4: Start the ngrok Tunnel**

This exposes your local webhook server to the internet so SendGrid and Slack can reach it.

# Replace with your static domain if you have one  
`ngrok http 8000 --domain <your.static.domain.ngrok-free.app>`

### **Running an Outbound Campaign (On-Demand)**

Once the four services above are running, you can trigger a new email outreach campaign at any time by running the following command in a **new terminal**:

`poetry run python -m app.main`

## **üîÆ Future Work & Roadmap**

* **State Management & Memory:** Implement a database (e.g., SQLite) to store conversation history, giving the SDR_Agent context for multi-turn conversations.  
* **Containerization:** Dockerize the entire application stack (web, worker, Redis) with docker-compose for consistent, one-command local setup and simplified deployment.
